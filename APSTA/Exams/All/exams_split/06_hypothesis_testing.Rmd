# HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### Mock 2023 - 5. Hypothesis testing (8 pts)

Consider a practical situation that you evaluate two brands of ice cream
A and B. The reported weight of each ice cream package is nominally the
same (100g) but after consuming of the two brands, you feel that the ice
cream A runs out earlier than the ice cream B. To investigate if your
feeling is suggesting right, you want to make a statistical test
evaluating if there is less ice cream in the brand A package when
compared to the brand B package. To do the testing, you have 5 packages
from each ice cream brand, and you weigh them to get the measurements
$W_A=(99.2,100.5,98.9,99.6,97.7)$ for the brand A and
$W_B=(100.5,100.1,99.1,98.2,98.3)$ for the brand B, where the
measurements are in grams.

(a) (1pt) Formulate the appropriate null hypothesis and alternative
    hypothesis.
(b) (1pt) Why is bootstrapping a good strategy for testing the
    hypothesis, if compared to t-testing?
(c) (5pts) Make a program that tests the null hypothesis by
    bootstrapping.
(d) (1pt) Report your conclusions at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

### Mock 2021 - 5. Bootstrapping & Hypothesis testing (8 pts)

The data set chicken (UsingR) contains the weight gain of chicken fed
with three different rations. You would like to find if there is
statistical evidence that the ration 2 gave more weight gain than
ration1.

(a) Formulate the appropriate null hypothesis and alternative
    hypothesis. (1pt)

(b) Why is bootstrapping a good strategy in testing the hypothesis?
    (1pt)

(c) Make a program that tests the null hypothesis by bootstrapping.
    (5pts)

(d) Report your conclusions at significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05. (1pt)

### Re-exam 2020 - 3.Hypothesis testing (6pts)

The paired test is an another from of hypothesis testing that suites for
a situation when two samples depend on each other is some way, for
instance, the samples from twin studies. Two paired samples can be
compared by a one-sample test. For paired samples x1, x2, . . . , xn and
y1, y2, . . . , yn (where (xi , yi), i = 1, 2, . . . , n are the pairs)
one then considers the differences x1 - y1, x2 - y2, . . . , xn - yn
(instead of incorrectly using the two-sample test with the assumption of
two independent sets of samples). Consider the data babies (UsingR). The
variable age contains the mom's age and dage the corresponding (paired)
dad's age. You would like to assess if there is statistical evidence
that the child's mum is younger than child's dad.

(a) Formulate the appropriate null hypothesis and alternative
    hypothesis. (2pts)

(b) Which test is appropriate for testing the hypothesis? Explain why.
    (2pts)

(c) Do the test and report your conclusion at significance level
    $\alpha$ = 0.05. (2pts) Hint: if the age of the mum or dad is
    unknown it is indicated by the age 99 in the dataset, you need to
    filter out these first, for instance, by filtered.babies \<-
    subset(babies,age\<99 & dage\<99).

### Exam 2020 - 5 Bootstrapping & Hypothesis testing (8 pts)

The data set chicken (UsingR) contains the weight gain of chicken fed
with three different rations. You would like to find if there is
statistical evidence that the ration 2 gave more weight gain than ration
1.

(a) Formulate the appropriate null hypothesis and alternative
    hypothesis. (1pt)

(b) Why is bootstrapping a good strategy in testing the hypothesis?
    (1pt)

(c) Make a program that tests the null hypothesis by bootstrapping.
    (5pts)

(d) Report your conclusions at significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05. (1pt)

### Mock 2020 - 3. Hypothesis Testing (6pt)

According to the Danish ministry of education, when the Danish 7-point
grading scale (consisting of the grades -3, 00, 02, 4, 7, 10 and 12) is
used nationally and over a long period of time, the mean pass grade
should be 7. In the year 2028 you are looking at the grades for the 681
student who have passed the course in Applied Statistics at ITU in the
past 10 years. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the
grades are xÂ¯681 = 7.15 and s681 = 3.07. You observe that that the
sample mean is higher than 7, so you decide to investigate if the mean
grade for the Applied Statistics course may be different from 7 using
hypothesis testing. With 681 observations you can assume that this is a
large sample size.

(a) (1pt) Formulate an appropriate null hypothesis and alternative
    hypothesis.

(b) (1pt) Which test is appropriate for testing the hypothesis? Explain
    why.

(c) (2pt) Compute the value of the test statistic and report your
    conclusion at significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05.

(d) (2pt) Compute the corresponding one-tailed p-value. Is the evidence
    against the null hypothesis strong?

### Mock 2019 - 2 Hypothesis Testing (8pt)

According to the Danish ministry of education, when the Danish 7-point
grading scale (consisting of the grades $-3$, $00$, $02$, $4$, $7$, $10$
and $12$) is used nationally and over a long period of time, the mean
pass grade should be $7$. In the year 2028 you are looking at the grades
for the $681$ student who have passed the course in Applied Statistics
at ITU in the past 10 years. The sample mean and sample standard
deviation of the grades are $\bar{x}_{681} = 7.15$ and $s_{681} = 3.07$.
You observe that that the sample mean is higher than 7, so you decide to
investigate if the mean grade for the Applied Statistics course may be
different from $7$ using hypothesis testing. With 681 observations you
can assume that this is a large sample size.

(a) (1pt) Formulate an appropriate null hypothesis and alternative
    hypothesis.

Null hypothesis -\> $H_0: \mu=7$

Alternate hypothesis -\> $H_1: \mu > 7$

(b) (1pt) Which test is appropriate for testing the hypothesis? Explain
    why.

we use a one sample t-test; as we have a large sample size, we assume it
follows a standard normal distribution

(c) (3pt) Compute the value of the test statistic and report your
    conclusion at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

(d) (3pt) Compute the corresponding one-tailed $p$-value. Is the
    evidence against the null hypothesis strong?
