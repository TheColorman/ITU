# SMALL R PROBLEMS

### Mock 2023 - 4. Small R Problems (6 pts)

(a) (2pts) The historical data set `Langren1644` (`HistData`) contains
    the all the available estimates, in 1644, for the distance of Toldeo
    and Rome in longitude. Compute simple statistics such as mean,
    median, min, and max and standard deviation on the longitude. What
    can you conclude from these numbers?

(b) (2pts) The data set `iq` (\`UsingR) contains simulated IQ scores.
    Find the 95% confidence interval for the mean (simulated) IQ by
    assuming that this dataset is a random sample from a normal
    distribution with *unknown* standard deviation.

*Hint*: you have to translate the correct formula for the confidence
intervals to R code. In particular, condsider that the distribution
generating the samples is normal and that its standard deviation (and
hence the variance) is unknown (even though you can compute an estimate
for it from the data).

(c) The data set emissions (UsingR) contains the information of CO2
    emissions of different countries for 1999. Use a linear regression
    model to model the CO2 emission as a function of GDP per capita.
    Visualise the model together with the observations. What can you
    conclude from your results?

### Mock 2022 - 4. Small R Problems (8 pts)

(a) The data set `firstchi (UsingR)` contains the age of the mother at
    birth of the first child. Investigate the data set by computing
    several simple statistics on this data set. Summarise your findings.
    (2 pts)

(b) The data set `rat (Using R)` contains the survival times of 20 rats
    exposed to radiation. Visualise the data in appropriate means and
    discuss in the light of the data and your knowledge, what kind of
    parametric model would you choose for the distribution of the
    survival times. (2 pts)

(c) Consider the dataset `kid.weights (UsingR)`, that reports
    information about a sample of 250 kids. Select the kids up until 9
    years old (i.e. with an age strictly less than 108 months). Plot a
    scatter plot of the weight versus the height. Compute a linear
    regression model and add the regression line to the plot. What
    conclusions can you derive? (2 pts)

(d) Assume that you have implemented a scientific method that you
    compare to the state-of-the-art published elsewhere. You use the
    evaluation metric $G$ where a bigger value refers to a better
    outcome. Using independent experiments you get five scores for the
    state-of-the-art (0.908,0.915,0.908,0.905,0.904) and five for your
    method (0.910,0.914,0.909,0.914,0.910). State the null and
    alternative hypothesis and test if there is statistical evidence
    that your method is better than the state-of-the-art. (2 pts)
