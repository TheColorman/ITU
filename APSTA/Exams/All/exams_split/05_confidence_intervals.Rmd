# CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

### Exam 2019 - 3.Confidence intervals (3 pts)

You are performing an experiments, and you know that your results are a
random sample taken from a normal distribution with standard deviation
$\sigma = 2.2$.

(a)(2 pt) Suppose your random sample has size 30, with sample mean
$\bar{x}_{30} = 12.4$. Compute a two-sided 95% confidence interval for
the mean.

(b) (1 pt) Suppose you want the two-sided 95% confidence interval to
    have width $\leq 0.5$. How many samples do you need to take at
    least?

### Exam 2017 - 3. Confidence intervals (5pt)

Suppose that you want to examine the amount of caffeine in a cup of
espresso from Caf√© Analog. In a sample of 10 cups, the average measured
caffeine contents is $\bar{x}_{10}= 62.9$ (mg) and the sample standard
deviation is $s_{10} = 5.8$ (mg). You may assume that the measurements
are a realization of a random sample form an $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
distribution.

(a) (3pts) Construct a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$.

(b) (2pts) Assuming that the standard deviation is $\sigma = 5$ (mg),
    how many measurements do we need, if we want a 95% confidence
    interval for the mean $\mu$ no wider than 1 (mg)?
