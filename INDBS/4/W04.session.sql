-- 1. Create a view AllAccountRecords that joins the Accounts and AccountRecords and shows one entry for each record for each account. The view should show all columns from both tables, first Accounts and then AccountRecords, except the AccountRecords.AID column. Accounts with no entry in AccountRecords should be shown with NULLs in the columns for AccountRecords.
CREATE VIEW AllAccountRecords AS
SELECT
    accounts.aid, 
    pid, adate, 
    abalance, 
    aover,

    rtype, 
    ramount, 
    rbalance
 FROM accounts
LEFT OUTER JOIN accountrecords
ON accounts.aid = accountrecords.aid;
SELECT * FROM allaccountrecords;

-- 2. Create a trigger CheckBills for insertions to Bills that enforces a) that the amount must be non-negative, and b) that the due date must be in the future (tomorrow or later).
-- Optional: Forbid DELETE operations and allow UPDATE only on the pIsPaid attribute. This is reflected in the test script.

-- 3. Create a trigger on the AccountRecords table that does the following for each insertion: a) checks whether the amount is available (taking the overdraft into account) on the account being withdrawn from, b) updates the balance on the account and c) installs the correct balance into the AccountRecords entry.
-- Optional: Forbid DELETE and UPDATE operations. This is reflected in the test script.
