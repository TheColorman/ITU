After swapping, <span style=\"color: blue\">lo</span> moves to the right, and <span style=\"color: orange;\">hi</span> moves to the left. [ <span style=\"color: red;\">A</span>, A, <span style=\"color: blue\">A</span>, A, A, <span style=\"color: orange;\">A</span>, A].  \n",

That means, on the second step, we do $N/2-2$ compares, *twice* (once for each subarray). This continues, with $(N/2-1)/2-1$ comparisons in further subarrays. This continues until the final compare, where the subarray has two elements, one of them being the pivot. At this point, it is important to notice that an element that has been a pivot never gets compared again. At the point of the final compare, half of the elements in the array have been pivots, so there are $N/2$ compares left to do.  \n",
