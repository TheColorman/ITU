According to the contract, I have to pay at least 100 DKK per month for voice calls whether I use them or not, but the contract automatically ‘rolls over’ the unused minutes to the next month. I have to call my mum for Christmas for a 2-hour call. Describe the expense in terms of ‘money I spend on voice calls each month’ in the worst case and in the amortised sense.  \n",
